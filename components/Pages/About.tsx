        A software developer (still not an engineer, hopefully soon{" "}
        <span role="icon">ðŸ¥´</span>). Been writing some words and symbols that
        makes other stuff appear on screens since I was 12. Being a visual
        person, I've always gravitated towards stuff that's flashy. Who even
        reads this? I'm not sure. I do front-end stuff, but I also do other
        stuff I guess?

        I like TypeScript, but it's insanely slow. I blame Microsoft for that.
        That's why I started branching out to other languages. Currently having
        a love affair with Rust and I think I might be falling in love.

        I've worked on a handful of projects, but I'm currently working as a
        Lead/Architect @ <a href="https://pabau.com">Pabau</a>

        Here's a little rundown of what I know and what tech I've used and for
        how long.
